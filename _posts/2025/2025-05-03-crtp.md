# A Quick but Relevant Digression on Virtual Dispatch
Consider the following example reviewing inherintance and dynamic polymorphism.  
```cpp
struct Animal {
    virtual ~Animal() = default;

    virtual string make_noise() = 0;
};

struct Dog : public Animal {
    ~Dog() override {}

    string make_noise() override { return "bork"; }
};


int main (){
    Animal* dog1 = new Dog();
    // prints "bork"
    cout << dog1->make_noise() << endl;
    delete dog1;

    return 0;
}
```
In particular, we are able to access `Dog`'s `make_noise` method even through a pointer of type `Animal*`.

Let's take a look at the memory layout of our example of dynamic polymorphism in the pictured above.  The `dog1` object contains a pointer vptr to the `Dog` classes's `vtable`.
This vtable will be shared across all instances of `Dog` and will hold pointers to all virtual methods from the base `Animal` class.  All instances of `Dog` will have vptrs directed at the same vtable stored in read-only memory. In this example, there is only one virtual method in the vtable: `make_noise`.

This is a fine technical implementation of dynamic polymorphism and is perfectly usable in numerous applications, but brings about the following problems for those seeking the most performant code:

1. Each `Dog` object will contain its respective vptr, increasing its memory footprint by the size of a pointer.
2. Each invocation of `make_noise()` will involve pointer indirection via the vptr and will never be optimized away by the compiler due to the runtime nature of runtime polymorphism.

A common way to avoid these deficiencies is through ✨templates✨.

## The Problem at Hand
Before describing CRTP, let's dive into a specific non-templated implementation.

```cpp
// Template pattern
struct Animal {
    virtual ~Animal() = default;

    virtual string make_noise() = 0;
    string make_more_noise() {
        return make_noise() + ' ' + make_noise() + ' ' + make_noise();
    }
};

struct Dog : public Animal {
    ~Dog() override {}

    string make_noise() override { return "bork"; }
};

struct Cat : public Animal {
    ~Cat() override {}

    string make_noise() override { return "meow"; }
};

int main (){
    Animal* dog = new Dog();
    Animal* cat = new Cat();
    // prints "bork bork bork"
    cout << dog->make_more_noise() << endl;
    // prints "meow meow meow"
    cout << cat->make_more_noise() << endl;
    delete dog;
    delete cat;

    return 0;
}
```

Here, we are effectively leveraging the template pattern in the abstract class `Animal`.  Subclasses of `Animal` must implement the `make_noise` method, and in doing so will also define the implementation of `make_more_noise`.
This is beneficial as we share the implementation of `make_more_noise` across all subclasses.

As discussed earlier, however, this implemetation carries the same unperformant characteristics previously discussed: (1) An slightly enlarged memory footprint for each object to accomodate the vptr and (2) additonal pointer indirection during invocations of virtual methods.

CRTP is a templated solution to address this.

# The Curious and Recurring Template Solution

Let's take a moment to analyze the following code. The magic is in the code.

```cpp
template <typename T>
struct Animal {
    string make_more_noise(){
        auto* t = static_cast<T*>(this);
        return t->make_noise() + ' ' + t->make_noise() + ' ' + t->make_noise();
    }
};

struct Dog : public Animal<Dog>{
    string make_noise(){
        return "bork";
    }
};

struct Cat : public Animal<Cat>{
    string make_noise(){
        return "meow";
    }
};

int main (){
    Dog dog;
    Cat cat;
    // prints "bork bork bork"
    cout << dog.make_more_noise() << endl;
    // prints "meow meow meow"
    cout << cat.make_more_noise() << endl;
}
```
To those unfamiliar with CRTP, it may not be obvious that this compiles. In defining a subclass of `Animal`, the definition of `Dog` passes itself as the template argument to `Animal`.  This all feels very self-referential as the definiton of `Dog` depends on `Animal<Dog>` which in turn depends on the definition of `Dog` again...

For reasons I will not (can not) explain, this compiles and works just as the definition of `make_more_noise` makes out to be.  Instead of using virtual dispatch within the base class to invoke functions of the subclass, that information is passed as a template parameter and parsed at compile time.
And since everything is managed at compile time, there is no need for subclasses to internally contain a vptr or lean into pointer indirection during function invocation!
