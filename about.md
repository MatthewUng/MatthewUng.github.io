Hi!
I am currently working as a software engineer in the SF Bay Area.  
My interests revolve around mathy, computer-sciency, and possibly other diverse flavor-of-the-month topics that I stumble upon.
This blog is meant to collect and foster my own thoughts, and to share ideas of values to those who are interested.
